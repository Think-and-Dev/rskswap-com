<Info>
UniswapV2Router01 should not be used any longer, because of the discovery of a <Link to='/docs/v2/smart-contracts/router01#getamountin'>low severity bug</Link> and the fact that some methods do not work with tokens that take fees on transfer. The current recommendation is to use <Link to='/docs/v2/smart-contracts/router02'>UniswapV2Router02</Link>.
