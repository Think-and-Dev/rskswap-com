Uniswap RSK V2, the second iteration of the Uniswap protocol, has been [deployed to the RSK mainnet](https://explorer.rsk.co/address/0xf55c496bB1058690DB1401c4B9C19f3f44374961?__ctab=Code)!

An [audit report and formal verification](/audit.html) has already been released.

Developers can begin building on Uniswap RSK V2 immediately! Initial [docs](/docs/v2) and [example projects](http://github.com/Think-and-Dev/uniswap-v2-periphery/tree/master/contracts/examples) are already available.

Today, An updated open source [interface](https://app.rskswap.com/) for swapping and liquidity provision on Uniswap RSK V2  is also being released:

Uniswap V2 has many new features and technical improvements compared with Uniswap V1 including:

- ERC20 / ERC20 Pairs
- Price Oracles
- Flash Swaps
- And much more!

For full details on the benefits of Uniswap V2 for liquidity providers and traders, please read the Uniswap V2 [announcement blog post](/blog/uniswap-v2). For more information on the launch please read below.


## Updated Interface

The open source [interface](https://app.rskswap.com/) has been updated to work with Uniswap V2 on RSK!

It now supports creating and providing liquidity in ERC20 / ERC20 pairs, such as DOC/RIF.

Swapping logic has been updated to properly route between ERC20 / ERC20 pairs.

While Uniswap V2 uses WRBTC, this is abstracted in the interface and RBTC can be used directly.
